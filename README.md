# Scrollytelling demo using scrollama.js and d3.js
This repository contains a demo setup for *scrollytelling*. It uses scrollama.js and d3.js (v3.5). The setup assumes you have a screen that is at least 1100 pixels wide and it has only been tested on a modern Firefox browser.

## Background

I have created this demo for exploratory purposes. I heard about this thing called *scrollytelling*; a way to scroll through a story while some part of the website sticks around and updates dynamically. It sounded like a great way to tell stories on the web and that's the very reason I wanted to give it a try. I applied it to the story behind one of my personal projects. This repository is the result. 

[You can view a live demo here](http://edriessen.com/app/scrollytelling-demo/).

## Data and technology

The data are generated using my [Avicii Open Data Art project](https://github.com/edriessen/avicii-project) (Python). It uses Google's Natural Language API to turn music lyrics into sentiment data (details are in the project repo). The data for this demo are in `data/avciiTimData.js`. It includes two types of data:

- the `data` variable holds an array of songs; each song has 4 attributes: an index, title, score and magnitude.
- the `bezierData` variable holds an array of nested arrays; each nested array holds the coordinates to draw a (Bezier) path.

Besides that, I use two libraries:

- [scrollama.js](https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/) for scrollytelling functionality. 
- [d3.js libraries (v3.5)](https://d3js.org/) libraries to visualise data and animate between states. Used plots and animations are: scatterplot, (Bezier)paths, changing position of plotted elements, changing value range of axes, changing visibility of axes, and animating drawing a path. *Links to the examples I used for these are listed below.* 

And I use some vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to use

With this demo, I aim to give people a head start in srollytelling using scrollama with D3. It uses a small, understandable, dataset of 12 items with two variables. The custom code is for scrollama is in `scrollama-settings.js` and the custom code for d3 is in `d3-animations.js`. 

The magic of this scrollytelling demo is in the interaction between the scrollama and d3. Scrollama allows you to trigger some code at a certain point in the story. If the code you trigger is a nice d3 animation, the results get pretty nice quite quickly. 

## Challenges

Scrollama allows you track where you are in the story (the nth element) and if the user is scrolling up or down (and probably some more stuff I don't know of). I currently assume that a user starts at the top of the story. After that, I capture both the downwards and upwards scrolling events correctly. I haven't captured two other user scenario's:

- a user that just scrolls very fast, too fast for animations to keep up. 
- a user that lands at some point after the first story element. 

I won't be fixing these, as they are resolved when a user restarts at the beginning (read: users that relax and take their time to slowly scroll to the top).

## What's next

I plan to implement a few updates to the project:

- ~~Change the colours for sentiment to a more colour-blind-friendly colour scheme~~
- Add a technical note to each story element explaining what changes happen in the background
- Add some images to this repo
- ~~Add a Dutch version~~
- Add other languages (if you want to help, [reach out](http://www.edriessen.com/contact/))
- Maybe rewrite some code (it now really is a blend of various sources)

## Acknowledgements

Phoe, where to start. This project combines the knowledge of various people and blogposts. I'll aim to include them here: 

- [Tiago Marnh√£o Barreto Pereira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagombp/): for showing a great example of scrollytelling with D3, inspiring me to give it a try myself, and helping me out with some great references. 
- [Scrollama.js](https://pudding.cool/process/introducing-scrollama/): they have great documentation and a some good examples of various basic setups (I based my demo on the [sticky overlay setup](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/sticky-overlay/)). 
- [D3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/): I used various examples to test try out the various stages of my animation:   
  - [Drawing paths](http://using-d3js.com/05_01_paths.html): a good overview of path-drawing options in D3. 
  - [Animated paths](https://www.yerich.net/blog/bezier-curve-animation-using-d3): Richard Ye shares a great trick on how to animated paths with D3. 
  - D3.js Graph Gallery: Yan Holtz offers some great and understandable resources on all sorts of things related to D3. One of them is transitions. I think their pages do a really good job at explaining a simple concept and increasing the complexity of it step by step. I'll refer to two I have used for this demo: [bubble chart with data tooltip](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/bubble_tooltip.html) and [various chart animations](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_transition.html).
- **Avicii**: I just can't not name him in any project that somehow touches his music. He still is a great inspiration that led me to work on some very interesting projects and develop new skills. I now get more enjoyment out creatively applying my skills and sharing projects with other people. (And the colour pallet of this demo is based on the cover art for TIM).
